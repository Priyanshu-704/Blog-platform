# BLOG PLATFORM

## Overview
The Simple Blog Platform is a web-based application built with React that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts. Each blog post consists of a title, description, and an image, and is displayed in a visually appealing card format.

The platform is designed to be user-friendly and provides a straightforward interface for managing blog content.

**Note :** This project was developed as a part of my internship at **CodSoft**.

## Features
**Create Posts :** Users can create new blog posts by providing a title, description, and an image URL. 

**Edit Posts :** Users can edit existing blog posts by clicking the "Edit" button on a post card.


**Delete Posts :** Users can delete blog posts by clicking the "Delete" button on a post card. This action removes the post from the list, ensuring that the content stays relevant and up-to-date.

**Responsive Design :** The platform is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
**React :** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing the foundation for the application's frontend.
